= Maven 3 - Separation of build & consumer

- POM contains build information - which is not relevant to a consumer! +
&nbsp;

- Building an artifact produces a .pom file which contains irrelevant info +
&nbsp;

- Once again both third party plugins come in handy: +
*Codehaus* : _flatten-maven-plugin_ +

- See Issue: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7880[MnG-7880]
